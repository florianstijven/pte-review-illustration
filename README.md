# Proportion of Treatment Effect Explained: An Overview of Interpretations

This repository contains the R-code for the data illustration in "Proportion of
Treatment Effect Explained: An Overview of Interpretations". The
`illustration-vaccine-trials.Rmd` file contains all R-code. Knitting this file
produces `illustration-vaccine-trials.pdf`, `illustration-vaccine-trials.md`, or
`illustration-vaccine-trials.html`, depending on the selected output format.
These three files are also present in this repository. The
`illustration-vaccine-trials.md` file can be rendered and viewed on github.

This project uses the `renv` package to maintain a reproducible environment. If
you want to run this code, we recommend copying the entire repository. When you
open this project, `renv` will then ask you if you want to download and install
all the packages it needs by running `renv::restore()`.
